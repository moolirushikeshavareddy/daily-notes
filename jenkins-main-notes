Class-1
------------
->it is a ci/cd tool
Ex:
->Jenkins
->gitlab
->argo cd
->buddy
->code ship
->circleci
->aws code pipeline
->aws code deploy
->semaphore
->teamcity
->GitHub actions
->travis ci
->bamboo
->bitbucket
->google cloud platform
->azure Devops

ci : continuous integration ---->continuous build + continuous test
->we are continuously building and testing the old code with new code
->before ci we have time waste and everything is manual work---->90's
->after ci everything is automated

cd : continuous delivery----->deployment manually to production environment
cd : continuous deployment-->deployment automatically to production environment

->to create ci/cd we need to create pipeline

PIPELINE:
->step by step execution of a particular process (or)
->series of events interlinked with events
code--->build--->test--->deploy

ENVIRONMENTS:
dev	: developers
qa	: testers
uat	: client
->the first three environments are called pre-prod or non-prod and for Devops team
prod	: users
->prod environment is also known as live environment

->if we want to create ci/cd pipeline we need to have Jenkins

JENKINS:
->it is a free and open-source tool
->it is platform independent
->it is build on java-11
->kohsuke kawaguchi invented jenkins in sun micro systems 2004
->initial name was Hudson---> paid version
->later oracle brought the Jenkins and made it free and open version
->it consists lot of plugins
->default port number for Jenkins is 8080

SETUP:
->create ec2 with all traffic (8000)
#STEP-1: INSTALLING GIT JAVA-1.8.0 MAVEN 
yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk maven -y

#STEP-2: GETTING THE REPO (jenkins.io --> download -- > redhat)
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

#STEP-3: DOWNLOAD JAVA11 AND JENKINS
amazon-linux-extras install java-openjdk11 -y	or sudo yum install java-11
yum install jenkins -y
update-alternatives --config java		: to list all java versions and choose the rquired version and press enter

#STEP-4: RESTARTING JENKINS (when we download service it will on stopped state)
systemctl start jenkins.service
systemctl status jenkins.service

BROWSER:
->copy the public_ip and paste on browser like this 
->public-ip:8080

PASSWORD:
->for password â€”>cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
->after install plugins and create user for login

INTEGRATION OF GIT AND MAVEN WITH JENKINS:
CREATE A JOB:
->New item---> name : Netflix ci job--->free style--->ok
->source code management-->select git-->github link
->build steps-->add setup--->execute shell--mvn clean package (cotent)--->save
